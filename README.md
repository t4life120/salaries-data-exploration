# Salaries Exploration with Pandas
In this GitHub Repository you can find Day 71 of 100 Days of Code from [Dr. Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) and [The London App Brewery](https://github.com/londonappbrewery). On this day the challenge was to explore salaries by College Majors. The data is originally from [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors).
